                        <br>

                        about how i collect and use information from users, to keep <br>

                    <h4>ADVERTISEMENT</h4>
                    <p>
                        If my apps is free. I will put advertisement in those apps. <br>
                        I have already chosen the ads provider that save for kids. <br>
                        However, i'm not able to control all of advertisements because <br>
                        AdNetwork has more control to select the content of the advertisement.
